# Project Agent & Contributor Guidelines

Agents and contributors must use the following documents to guide all work and decisions:

- **[PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md):** Review for product vision, goals, and user scenarios. Ensure all features and changes align with the documented objectives.
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md):** Follow the system architecture, design principles, and modularity guidelines. All code and design decisions should comply with the described structure and extensibility requirements.
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md):** Adhere to developer guidelines, code style, testing, and collaboration practices. All contributions must follow these standards.

## Agent Workflow
1. **Always consult PRODUCT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md before starting any new task or feature.**
2. **If you find incomplete, outdated, or conflicting information in any document, suggest and/or make updates immediately.**
3. **Document all major changes and keep documentation synchronized with the codebase.**
4. **Prioritize modularity, extensibility, and testability in all work.**
5. **Communicate clearly with other contributors and maintainers.**

## Update Protocol
- When updating documents, ensure clarity, accuracy, and alignment with project goals.
- Notify maintainers of significant changes.

By following these guidelines, agents and contributors help maintain a robust, collaborative, and future-proof project.
