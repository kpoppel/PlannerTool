# People Configuration Schema
# Schema version 1
#
# This file configures the people database for the PlannerTool.
# The people database contains information about team members including
# their team assignments, sites, and employment type.

# Optional: Path to the main database YAML file
# Can be absolute or relative to the data directory
# If not specified, only inline entries will be used

# Optional: Inline database entries
# These entries override or extend the entries from database_file
# Entries are matched by name - if a name exists in both places,
# the inline entry takes precedence
